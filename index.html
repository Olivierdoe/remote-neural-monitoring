      <h1 class="text-center text-3xl">Remote Neural Monitoring</h1>
      <p class="mt-6">Remote Neural Monitoring is a non invasive functional neuroimaging technique allowing anyone’s brain to be turned into a camera and microphone device by decoding wirelessly acquired brain imaging data and extracting subvocalizations, visual and auditory perceptions using deep neural networks.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">The development of this technology started in the 50’s with the <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra">MKUltra</a> human experimentation program intended to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used in interrogatories to weaken individuals and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">On February 9, 1972, the Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA048258" class="text-blue-500">a contract to the Stanford Research Institute</a> (CSRI). The program director was Dr. George Lawrence and the contract was granted to Dr. Lawrence Pinneo to determine the feasibility of bio-cybernetic communication. More specifically, Dr. Pinneo was researching the feasibility of designing a communication link between man and computer using electrical activity of the brain during verbal thinking. The hypothesis was that the electrical activity of the brain during thought may be similar to the electrical activity of the brain during overt speech. The EEGs of the subjects were measured using scalp electrodes over the frontal-temporal lobes. “The research was predicated on the assumption that thought is nothing more than covert speech.” Subjects were shown picture cards of the words they were to think about as their EEGs were recorded. The research concluded that the EEG reveals similar responses during silent reading to that during overt speech and that these responses may be classified correctly by a computer with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">Many of the victims of MKULTRA had been unwitting subjects who had been lied to and coerced into unethical experimentation. The technologic limitations at the time had necessitated sequestering victims into psychiatric hospitals where they could be drugged and subjected to electro-convulsive therapy using electrodes placed on the scalp. Physiologic monitoring of the EEG and other vital signs also required sensors placed on the subject. In addition, things had become a little hot for the MKULTRA researchers by the early 1970’s. Victims’ complaints had prompted congressional hearings and the unethical experimentation conducted by the CIA on unwitting subjects began to be exposed. With Senator Ted Kennedy at the helm, CIA documents that survived the shredding machine painted a picture of bizarre unethical experimentation, mostly done through front companies. Had the CIA not sequestered victims in research centers for experimentation and left a paper trail, there may have never been disclosure in congressional hearings. The public was outraged at the abuse. The congress was dismayed. The CIA began looking for other ways to continue their mind control research with greater plausible deniability and less chance of getting caught with their pants down. The era of remote neural monitoring had begun.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">The research that followed focused on remotely sensing the small, electrical potentials generated by the brain. Remotely detecting brain waves would negate the need for scalp electrodes and alleviate the requirement for informal consent on the subjects. One researcher, Robert G. Malech, researched remotely monitoring and altering brain waves which culminated in the filing <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3951134A/en" class="text-blue-500">U.S. Patent number 3951134</a> in 1974. He had no idea that at this moment in history, he had accidentally destroyed democracy as we envision it to be. The military and surveillance community immediately picked up on the patent and within two years had reprogrammed their communications and surveillance satellites and terrestrial phased arrays with the new concepts. The rapid deployment of this technology occurred because it only required software changes in already existing radar, imaging, and communications’ terrestrial dishes and satellites. Many additional spy satellites have been launched since to bolster the system.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of the human perception of audible clicks, or even speech, induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The communications are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. In 1961, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of the auditory apparatus.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">Combining remote neural monitoring for data acquisition (from human brain to computer) and microwave auditory effect for data transmission (from computer to human brain) allows for a non invasive bio-cybernetic communication system providing synthetic telepathy feature. This technology is currently being used by a mafia network of intelligence agencies, prosecutors, politicians, businessmen, journalists, scientists etc.. for different purposes :</p>
      <ul class="mt-4">
        <li class="my-2">- surveillance : by remotely acquiring and decoding brain waves, it allows reading into people's mind, seeing through their eyes, hearing through their ears, seeing and hearing their dreams without their consent. Hundreds of millions of people’s brain imaging data is being collected in realtime and stored on servers where they can be reused to see into anyone’s past when necessary.</li>
        <li class="my-2">- blackmailing : the omniscience offered by this technology allows this mafia to trap and blackmail all influential people.</li>
        <li class="my-2">- recruitment : intelligence agencies use synthetic telepathy to perform intensive illegal interrogatories on people they want to recruit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-6">Synthetic telepathy is the holy grail of intelligence agencies allowing them to use a wide variety of mind control techniques to data mine people’s brain and brainwash them. Using microwave auditory effect, it is possible to replace people’s inner voice and pipe in voice commands directly into the subconscious mind. Through synthetic telepathy conversations it is possible to trigger memory recall tricking the target into remembering connected events.</p>

      <p class="mt-8">The next technology they are working on is Remote Neuromodulation which is about generating sensory experiences by wirelessly altering brain waves. It will allow engaging anyone in a full immersive virtual reality. Possible ways to achieve this are by delivering specifically engineered genes that code for a magnetised protein to the brain using an AAV virus or by delivering neuralnanorobots to the brain parenchyma and then altering brain waves using electromagnetic waves.</p>
