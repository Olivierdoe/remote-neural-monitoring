      <h1 class="text-center text-3xl">Remote Neural Monitoring</h1>
      <p class="mt-8">Remote Neural Monitoring is a non invasive <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging">functional neuroimaging</a> technique allowing anyone’s brain to be turned into a camera and microphone device by decoding wirelessly acquired brain imaging data and extracting subvocalizations, visual and auditory perceptions using deep neural networks.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">The development of this technology started in the 50’s with the <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra">MKUltra</a> program intended to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used in interrogatories to weaken individuals and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">The first demonstration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface" class="text-blue-500">Brain Computer Interface</a> in humans took place in the 1960s. In 1964, Grey Walter demonstrated use of non-invasively recorded encephalogram (EEG) signals from a human subject to control a slide projector (Graimann et al., 2010). In 1971 the term brain-computer interface (BCI) was coined by Jacques J. Vidal, who laid out a comprehensive experimental research plan to interface the human brain with computers (Vidal, 1973).</p>
      <p class="mt-6">On February 9, 1972, the Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA048258" class="text-blue-500">a contract to the Stanford Research Institute</a> (CSRI) to determine the feasibility of bio-cybernetic communication. More specifically, Dr. Pinneo was researching the feasibility of designing a communication link between man and computer using electrical activity of the brain during verbal thinking. The hypothesis was that the electrical activity of the brain during thought may be similar to the electrical activity of the brain during overt speech. The EEGs of the subjects were measured using scalp electrodes over the frontal-temporal lobes. “The research was predicated on the assumption that thought is nothing more than covert speech.” Subjects were shown picture cards of the words they were to think about as their EEGs were recorded. The research concluded that the EEG reveals similar responses during silent reading to that during overt speech and that these responses may be classified correctly by a computer with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">Many of the victims of MKULTRA had been unwitting subjects who had been lied to and coerced into unethical experimentation. Victims’ complaints had prompted congressional hearings and the unethical experimentation conducted by the CIA on unwitting subjects began to be exposed. With Senator Ted Kennedy at the helm, CIA documents that survived the shredding machine painted a picture of bizarre unethical experimentation, mostly done through front companies. The public was outraged at the abuse. The congress was dismayed. The CIA began looking for other ways to continue their mind control research with greater plausible deniability and less chance of getting caught. The era of <a href="https://www.remote-neural-monitoring.com/" class="text-blue-500">remote neural monitoring</a> had begun.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">The research that followed focused on remotely sensing the small electrical potentials generated by the brain electrical activity. Remotely detecting brain waves would negate the need for scalp electrodes and alleviate the requirement for informal consent on the subjects. One researcher, Robert G. Malech, researched remotely monitoring and altering brain waves which culminated in the filing <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3951134A/en" class="text-blue-500">U.S. Patent number 3951134</a> in 1974.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">Voice to skull is a communication technology which allows delivering sound to an individual by the mean of electromagnetic waves without any receiving device. There is 2 common ways to achieve this. The first one is by leveraging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect" class="text-blue-500">microwave auditory effect</a>. By beaming pulsed microwave to a person’s ear, a thermoelastic expansion of portions of the auditory apparatus occurs which leads to sound being heard. The second approach is by leveraging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoacoustic_effect" class="text-blue-500">photoacoustic effect</a>. By sweeping a laser beam at the speed of sound at a wavelength absorbed by water, sound waves are produced.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">Combining remote neural monitoring for data acquisition (from human brain to computer) and voice to skull for data transmission (from computer to human brain) allows for a non invasive bio-cybernetic communication system providing <a href="https://www.roi.ru/tmp/attachments/718817/synthetictelepathyandtheearlymindwars--kopiia1509733759.pdf" class="text-blue-500">synthetic telepathy</a> feature. This technology is currently being used by a mafia network of intelligence agencies for different purposes :</p>
      <ul class="mt-4">
        <li class="my-2">- surveillance : by remotely acquiring and decoding brain waves, it allows reading into people's mind, seeing through their eyes, hearing through their ears, seeing and hearing their dreams without their consent. Hundreds of millions of people’s brain imaging data is being collected in realtime and stored on servers where they can be reused to see into anyone’s past when necessary.</li>
        <li class="my-2">- blackmailing : the omniscience offered by this technology allows this mafia to trap and blackmail all influential people.</li>
        <li class="my-2">- recruitment : intelligence agencies use synthetic telepathy to perform intensive illegal interrogatories on people they want to recruit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-6">Synthetic telepathy allows intelligence agencies to use a wide variety of mind control techniques to data mine people’s brain and brainwash them. Using voice to skull, it is possible to replace people’s inner voice and pipe in voice commands directly into the subconscious mind. Through synthetic telepathy conversations it is possible to trigger memory recalls and trick a target into remembering connected events thus widening the mind map collection.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">It is important to keep in mind that in the same way that software vulnerabilities are being kept hidden by cybercriminals that exploit them in the wild, the brain vulnerability to electromagnetic waves performing functional neuroimaging is being kept as hidden as possible : scientists and doctors are being blackmailed and scientific publications are under control.</p>
      <p class="mt-6">To pry into people’s mind is the worst violation of privacy ever committed. Ability to pipe in instructions into people’s subconscious minds and filling their mental space with brainwashing instructions could jeopardize humanity.</p>
